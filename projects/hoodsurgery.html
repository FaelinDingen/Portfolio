                <h1>About Hood Surgery</h1>
                <p>
                    After my internship where i followed strict guidence i wanted to spread my wings a little bit.
                    So i made hood surgery.
                    It was originally a school project but after finnishing the assignment i had made all the tools to
                    make the game but hadn't really made much with the tools.
                    And so i started working on it in my free time with the goal of making it my first steam release.
                    Inspired by surgeon simulator i thought it was funny if a made an surgery game where you would
                    harvest the organs while keeping the patient alive.
                    I added more tools, fleshed out the enviroment and even added a little storyline.
                    Im still working on it in my spare time. The steam page will be comming soon.
                </p>

                <h1>Features</h1>

                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/hoodsurgeon/intro.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    This game is controlled purely by mouse. As this is quite unusual i made a small
                    introduction/tutorial to the game.
                    Here you need to go through a convinience store and check out your items.
                    There are note on the ground telling you the controlls and there is enough time to get used to them.
                    When exiting the store you will get kidnapped and brought to the facility where the main game takes
                    place.
                </p>

                <h2>Seamless in world menu</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/hoodsurgeon/menu.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    To strengthen the feeling of being trapped the menu takes place in the room that you are locked in.
                    There are notes dispenced on the table that you can use to tell the oporator of the facility what
                    you want.
                </p>

                <h2>The market</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/hoodsurgeon/shop.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    In the market you can use the money that you have gathered from selling the organs to buy new stuff.
                    This includes new tools, seringes, upgrades and more.
                </p>

                <h2>Useable Corkboard</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/hoodsurgeon/corkboard.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    On the front wall of the room there is a corkboard with stuff on it.
                    There are notes reminding you of the controlls and a little section encouraging you to break free.
                    There are 2 picture frames here. One is of your house. The other is of your pc's desktop background
                    image.
                    You can grab the pins and stick them back in the board.
                    If you grab a pin holding something up it will fall on the ground.
                </p>

                <h2>Tools</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/hoodsurgeon/hammer.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/hoodsurgeon/saw.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/hoodsurgeon/snippers.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    To harvest the organic matter you will need to disconect it from the body.
                    To do this you will need different tools for different things.
                    The hammer is used to bash the ribs open,
                    the saw is used to cut off limbs,
                    and the snippers are used to cut arteries to harvest internal organs.
                </p>

                <h2>Selling</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/hoodsurgeon/selling.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    After disconnecting the organs you can sell them by throwing them in the trashcan.
                    Everything has a different sell value that depends on how hard it is to get and how rare it is.
                    As an example the pancreas is worth way more than a rib.
                </p>

                <h2>Seringes</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/hoodsurgeon/seringes.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    Operating on the patient produces a lot of bloodloss and panic.
                    And our client only wants the freshest of the freshest ingridients.
                    So to keep the patient alive you can buy different types of seringes from the market.
                    These all do slightly different things to keep the patient alive for a little while longer.
                </p>

                <h2>Escaping</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/hoodsurgeon/escape.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    If you try hard enough you might be able to escape the facility and get the good ending.
                </p>

                <h2>Secrets</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/hoodsurgeon/secrets.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    If you go exploring you might find some secrets that can help you in your journey and even add a
                    little lore.
                </p>

                <h2>Upgrading</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/hoodsurgeon/upgrading.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    Somewhere in the facility someone has been hard at work.
                    They have created a machanical heart that can be used to greatly exctend the lifetime of the patient
                    that you are operating on.
                </p>

                <h2>Freedom</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/hoodsurgeon/freedom.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    If you harvest enough organic matter you will eventually be able to afford your own freedom.
                </p>

                <h2>The bad ending</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/hoodsurgeon/end.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    But freedom isnt what it seems like. You get drugged and now you will be the one getting operated
                    on.
                </p>
