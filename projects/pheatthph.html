            <h3>About Pheatthph</h3>
            <p>It's the end of my first year at collage and summer vacation just started.
                Me and 2 of my friends didn't have anything to do so we decided to make this game called Pheatthph.
                Pheatthph is a walking simulator where you need to go and explore multiple words to uncover what has happened to yours.
                It's an atmospheric and immersive game where you can sit back and relax while exploring wacky and zany worlds.
                <br> <br>
                We worked in an organized manner with GitHub and trello. We split up tasks between us, and we quickly made progress.
                I was in charge of one of the most important things in a walking simulator, You guessed it, Movement.
                <br>
                Sadly the development quickly stalled as we went on vacation and couldn't work on it further.
                <br>
                Here you can see some of my contributions.
            </p>

            <h2>Movement</h2>
            <img class="gifOrImage" src="../media/pheatthph/movement.gif" alt="Movement Gif">
            <p>
                I built movement (and camera movement) from the ground up. It was a lot of work and a lot of time fine-tuning, but eventually it turned out pretty good.
            </p>

            <p>
                One especially challenging part was slope movement.
                As the character will almost never move on flat terrain I really needed this to work as expected.
                I needed to rewrite a lot of my programming to make this work and even needed to change the whole system from a ray-casting based movement script to a system that uses colliders to detect ground.
                Another challenging aspect was walls. I needed to find a way to differentiate between slopes and walls as you could otherwise just walk on walls.
                I did this my calculating the angle of ground the player is walking on using a ray and then setting a threshold of a minimum and a maximum angle of ground that the player is able to walk on.

            <h2>Level Loaders</h2>
            <img class="gifOrImage" src="../media/pheatthph/levelLoading.gif" alt="levelLoading Gif">
            <p>
                The last thing I worked on is a level loading prefab.
                I wanted to make it as easy as possible to implement, so I made it really efficient and easy to adjust where it should send the player and how big the collider is.
