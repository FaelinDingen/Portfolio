                <h1>About Grangaly Grove</h1>
                <p>I've always been fascinated with atmosphere in games, from the brutal yet beautiful worlds of Hyper
                    Light Drifter and Katana Zero to the surprisingly relaxing feeling you get while playing the STALKER
                    games.
                    Atmosphere has always captivated me and has been a huge inspiration from my works.
                    <br><br>
                    Grangaly Grove started out as a first person shooter but that quickly became stale.
                    I wanted to do something that is unique, and so I ended up making this atmospheric experience where
                    you play as a ranger in charge of reporting suspicious activity in the woods.
                    You go out with your polaroid camera and take pictures of various things. You might even find some
                    people along the way.
                </p>

                <h1>Features</h1>

                <h2>Simple yet Nice TitleScreen</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/grangalysgrove/titlescreen.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    Ive always liked simple down to earth title screens. <br>So i took inspiration from other games such
                    as OuterWilds and Exo One and made this simple title screen with satisfying sounds for the buttons
                    and a nice view of the grove.
                </p>

                <h2>NPC's</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/grangalysgrove/npcs1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    I made some really versatile NPC's for the game with animations and a dialogue editor and
                    everything. <br>
                    I made these to creep the player out but also give a feeling of safety to the player.
                </p>

                <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/grangalysgrove/ambience1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    Atmosphere is very important in games, so I wanted to get it right in Grangaly Grove. <br>
                    Here you can see and the player getting scolded by your employer for quiting on the first day of the
                    job. <br>
                    I wanted to give the place a bit of mysterious vibe so a reflected that in the environment.
                </p>

                <h2>Car</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/grangalysgrove/car.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    I wanted the player to have the freedom of quiting the first day on the job as most horror games
                    don't let you do that. <br>
                    So here I added the option of getting in the car and driving away. <br>
                    Yes I did make a whole car controller for a joke ending, but it's pretty cool so im still proud of
                    it.
                </p>

                <h2>The Watchtower</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/grangalysgrove/cabin.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    This is your watchtower. Your base of operations. From here you can see the whole grove and spot
                    suspicious activity. <br>
                    This is also where you can see how many suspicious objects remain and when you have completed your
                    daily goal you can go to sleep to enter the next night. <br>
                    I designed this place to feel safe and de-stress as I think it's important in games to have a place
                    with downtime like the benches in Hollow Knight or the bomb fires in Dark Souls.
                </p>

                <h2>Equipment</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/grangalysgrove/equipment.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    The player currently has 3 pieces of equipment to work with. The camera, the flashlight and the
                    detector. <br>
                    The detector beeps when you get close to suspicious objects and continues to beep faster and faster
                    the closer you get. <br>
                    The flashlight is of course used to see more in the dark woods. <br>
                    <br>
                    And then there is the camera. The camera is used to capture the suspicious objects in the grove.
                    <br>
                    The camera has a small green light on the right side of the display which lights up when you have a
                    suspicious object in frame. <br>
                    This is done because when I let some of my friends play the game they always missed the object and
                    took a photo of something irrelevant. <br>
                    The camera can also zoom in and out and the green light takes that into account. If the object is
                    too small on screen it turns off and the photo doesn't count towards the paper in the cabin. <br>
                    When you take a photo with the camera the photo prints out, and you get a nice preview of the
                    captured frame.<br>
                    You can also tilt and zoom the photo however you like for a good view.
                </p>

                <h2>The Suspicious Objects</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/grangalysgrove/suspicousobjects.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    Every day different suspicious objects pop up around the grove. These come in many forms such as cow
                    skulls, campfires, and skeletons. <br>
                    After you take a photo of them with your polaroid camera they can do stuff in various ways from
                    putting out a fire to spawning monsters that run at you. <br>
                    With every capture of a suspicious object the counter in your cabin goes down by 1 and when you have
                    captured every object you can go to sleep. <br>
                    When you wake up there will be brand new suspicious objects for you to capture.
                </p>
