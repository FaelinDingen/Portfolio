            <h3>About Rifles & Revelations</h3>
            <p>
                Rifles & Revelations was my first dive into Unity 3d.
                We got a collage assignment to make a first-person shooter and the requirements where very low, so I was done pretty fast.
                I decided to spend my free time adding more cool stuff to my game, and it eventually grew into this cool tech demo for a fast-paced FPS game.
                Here you can find some interesting features that I added.
            </p>

            <h1>Features</h1>

            <h2>ICE</h2>
            <img class="gifOrImage" src="../media/r&r/ice.gif" alt="ICE Gif">
            <p>
                I had enemies that can take away health but there was no way to get it back. So I made a healing system that also ties in with the abstract story of the game.
                ICE is a drug that the people of this world have become addicted to. Enemies drop ICE on death, and you can pick it up and store up to 7 in your bong.
                Upon healing (Pressing H) the player will take a sip of this ice and heal 25 health and get a short speed boost to run away from enemies.
                I Thought just healing would be a boring addition to the game for suck a big mechanic, so I gave it 2 use cases where the player can use it.
                They can use it for healing or to get away from enemies.
            </p>

            <h2>Day/night cycle</h2>
            <img class="gifOrImage" src="../media/r&r/cycle.gif" alt="day and night cycle Gif">
            <p>
                To keep the game interesting I made a day and night cycle and a flashlight so that you can see at night.
                This makes some easy natural difficulty scaling and has a cool horror like effect on the gameplay.
            </p>

            <h2>Guns</h2>
            <img class="gifOrImage" src="../media/r&r/guns.gif" alt="Guns Gif">
            <p>
                Since this is a first-person shooter it should have guns. I made 3 main guns: the pistol, rifle and sniper.
                Each have their own advantages and disadvantages and are well balanced. I also made all the models myself.
            </p>

            <h2>Gravity gun</h2>
            <img class="gifOrImage" src="../media/r&r/gravityGun.gif" alt="Gravity Gun Gif">
            <p>
                One thing I thought that would be cool to add in this game was a gravity gun. So I made one.
                It can pick up objects and move them places. Pretty cool eh?
            </p>

            <h2>Physics</h2>
            <img class="gifOrImage" src="../media/r&r/physics.gif" alt="Physics Gif">
            <p>
                So as you can probably figure out by now, I just add things I find fun to this game.
                I love experimenting with fun features and figuring out how to add them to my project.
                Physics is always cool to have. so I gave the guns the ability to knock back physics objects.
