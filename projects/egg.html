                <h1>About Egg</h1>
                <p>
                    Egg is the result of a 24 hour gamejam where the theme was simply "Egg".
                    Egg is about an egg which just finnished school and needs to go home.
                    Its home lies in a piecefull field of lushious green grass.
                    But something doesnt feel right...
                    What should be a peacefull roll home ends up being an intence chase because the whisks are after
                    you!
                    Dodge the whisks by using your Extra Mass Mode and make your way back to your peacefull home.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was an intence 24 hours and i definitely learnt a lot. And i came 2nd place!
                    It was also featured on a Youtube Video which can be seen <a
                        href="https://youtu.be/rVUJWGnnLyw?si=bFi7v_YaNiQT7v0p" class="highlightable link">here</a>
                </p>

                <h1>Features</h1>

                <h2>Ethereal Gameplay</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/egg/eatherialgameplay.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    I wanted the player to be relaxed and nostalgic when playing the game.
                    So i made the main gameplay about rolling through fields of grass as an egg.
                    The colors are oversaturated, the egg has a badly drawn face on it, the sky looks like a kids
                    drawing.
                    Its all quite otherworldy.
                </p>

                <h2>Extra Mass Mode</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/egg/mass.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/egg/masssystem.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    To make the traversal of the hills more interesting i added the ability to increase your mass when
                    clicking.
                    This can be used to accelerate downhill and launch yourself with your accumulated momentum.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When in the air it just adds velocity downwards but when on the ground i made it so that the
                    velocity points downhill.
                    This makes it feel way more natural.
                    <br>
                    The direction of the velocity can be seen by looking at the red rays.
                </p>

                <h2>Whisks</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/egg/whisks.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    About thinking what an egg would be scared of i came to the conclusion that whisks are terrifying.
                    After a certain amount of time rolling though the fields you will get an popup simply saying "Whisks
                    are comming".
                    Whisks spawn and chase you down. You will have to avoid them or else they will scramble you!
                    Because of the unique shape of a whisk you can dodge and fly between the prongs or handle to
                    outmaneuver them.
                </p>

                <h2>Home</h2>
                <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="../media/egg/home.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    Eventually by following the arrow at the top of your screen you will make it home.
                    Here you are safe from the whisks.
                    You will also be able to see your time.
                </p>
