            <h1>About Goldfish Dreams</h1>
            <p>
                Goldfish Dreams was a game I developed with the help of two close friends.
                We participated in a game jam, and the theme that caught our attention was "Goldfish Dreams."
                I took on the role of project manager and main developer, while my friends, an artist and a composer,
                contributed their talents to the game. In just two days, we created a game that I'm incredibly proud of,
                where players control a fish that jumps between bodies and uses them to defeat opponents,
                drawing inspiration from games like Hotline Miami and Post Void. The experience was a thrilling adventure,
                and the result is a game that showcases our collective creativity and hard work.
            </p>

            <h1>Features</h1>

            <h2>High Octane Gameplay</h2>

                <source src="../media/goldfishdreams/gameplay.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
            <p>
                I really wanted to make the game feel snappy and fast. To achieve this is I added deep and impactful sfx,
                the perfect amount of screen shake, tight and responsive controls and a fast retry with no reloads.
                It looked like I nailed it as I got a lot of praise for the controls, screenshake and sound effects.
            </p>

            <h2>Switching Bodies</h2>
            <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                <source src="../media/goldfishdreams/body.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
            <p>
                So in this game you play as a fish that wants to take down "Goldfish Corp". However, you are a fish.
                So to take them down you take over other peoples bodies and use their bodies and weapons to achieve your goal.
                You cant reload as a fish as that requires too much brain power so when empty you need to switch body to get a fresh gun.
                When switching you abandon your current body and jump towards an enemy.
                While in fish form you cant take damage from bullets but if you miss an enemy you will quickly die from getting slammed against a wall.
                When you hit an enemy you take them over and control your new container, and you get the gun they were using.
            </p>

            <h2>Guns</h2>
            <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                <source src="../media/goldfishdreams/guns.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
            <p>
                The primary way of attack is via shooting. So I added multiple guns.
                Every gun has their own use-cases.
                The revolver is reliable and accurate, The shotgun is powerful but has low ammo and very inaccurate
                and then there is the rifle which shoots fast, is accurate and has high ammo but is hard to get your hands on.
            </p>

            <h2>Upgrades</h2>
            <video class="gifOrImage" autoplay muted loop>
                <source src="../media/goldfishdreams/upgrades.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
            <p>
                At the end of each stage you get a random selection of upgrades that you can pick 1 of to use.
                I implemented these to keep the game new and refreshing, and it keeps players coming back to try and make a powerful build that completely breaks the game.
                From controlling multiple characters to duplicating the bullets you shoot. The Upgrades are all unique and fun to experiment with.
            </p>
